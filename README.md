This a full fledged Library Management system with backend frontend and database using mySQL
As i would recommend to use this project for your works 
also its backend is in python then you all need to initialise new modules in it to run it through the backend process
   a> pip install flask werkzeug smtplib
   b> I would reccomend you to use the new python version of it ...
and that's all now you are ready to go with the library management system 
just write "python app.py " it will run as i dosent have included many python files due to its hard to manage all files in the program...
and that's all 
Thank you For Using our Library Management System....

For Further Information of the project you can check this out on its deployment website
